/imagine Create an image of two young women, Myself and Emily, hiking up a path in Sausalito from the shore line. The path is surrounded by lush greenery and tall trees. In the distance, the San Francisco skyline and the Golden Gate Bridge can be seen. As they approach Sausalito, they stand at the edge of a cliff overlooking the picturesque view of the shoreline. In the foreground, there is a small church with a bench where Myself sits, looking out at the scenery. The sun shines warmly on them, and there is a sense of peace and tranquility in the air. Make a comic illustration.
